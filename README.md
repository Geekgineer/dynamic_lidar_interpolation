## üîç Why Interpolation Matters ?

LiDAR sensors often produce sparse or inconsistent point clouds due to environmental conditions, affecting perception in autonomous systems. 
This package provides advanced interpolation techniques, ensuring complete and reliable point clouds for enhanced perception.

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure your system has ROS2 installed, along with the necessary dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-humble-pcl-ros
sudo apt install libeigen3-dev
```

### Clone and Build

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/geekgineer/dynamic_lidar_interpolation.git
    cd dynamic_lidar_interpolation
    ```

2. Build the workspace using `colcon`:
    ```bash
    colcon build
    ```

3. Source the workspace:
    ```bash
    source install/setup.bash
    ```

## üöÄ Running the Package

> [!NOTE]  
>  Refer to the [interpolation_config](config/interpolation_config.yaml) file to customize the behavior 

Make sure to download the sample bag from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uA7x1i5TlUeSm473ewYDzIrcny5JK8v7?usp=sharing)
to test the interpolation node with a recorded ROS2 bag file:

```bash
ros2 bag play data/velodyne_vlp16_outdoor --rate 1.0 --loop --clock
```

Then, launch the interpolation node using log level debug, info, warn, error, or fatal as needed:

```bash
colcon build --packages-select dynamic_lidar_interpolation --cmake-clean-cache

ros2 launch dynamic_lidar_interpolation pointcloud_interpolation_launch.py log_level:=info

```

> [!TIP]
> For production environments, you might want to limit debug logs to reduce verbosity.
